OpenSpartan is a project that [I](https://den.dev) started as a labor of love and appreciation for the Halo universe. I've played [every single Halo ever released](https://den.dev/blog/halo-legendary/) since 2012 and one curious aspect was something that was always front and center for me - **data around the gameplay**. Since the release of Halo Infinite, I've been diving into the [depths of the public, yet undocumented Halo Infinite APIs](https://den.dev/tags/halo-api/) which allowed me to spin up quite a few projects in my quest to analyze my own match performance.

These projects include:

- A companion app for Halo Infinite that runs on Windows [OpenSpartan Workshop](https://www.openspartan.com/docs/workshop/guides/get-started).
- [GruntAPI](https://gruntapi.com), an upcoming cross-platform Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool to query Halo Infinite data from the terminal.
- [OpenSpartan Wait Times Datasets](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/waittimes-datasets), an open-source aggregation of wait times for Halo Infinite.
- [A CLI tool](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/xuid-resolver) to get Xbox User IDs (XUIDs) from Xbox Gamertags.
- [Bond Reader](https://github.com/dend/bond-reader), an open-source tool that allows unpacking the contents of [Bond-encoded API responses](https://den.dev/blog/parsing-halo-api-bond/).
- Orion (formerly known as Grunt API), a full .NET implementation of the Halo Infinite API surface, that has since become closed-source, but still powers experiences such as [OpenSpartan Workshop](https://www.openspartan.com/docs/workshop/guides/get-started) and [GruntAPI](https://gruntapi.com).

The more I built those out, the more I discovered that I really enjoy building developer tools for Halo in my free time and documenting the end-to-end experience. OpenSpartan is all about shining a light on my explorations and enhancing the tools one might need to explore Halo Infinite statistics.
