In addition to working on OpenSpartan, Den [writes on his blog](https://den.dev), [hosts a podcast](https://theworkitem.com), and helps developers [build more secure applications at Microsoft](https://msal.dev). On the rare occasion that he has free time, he tries to play a few matches of Halo Infinite (usually Husky Raid or Tactical Slayer), or enjoy the outdoors.
