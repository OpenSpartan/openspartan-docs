There are a few improvements here that are worth mentioning:

- [[#30](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop/issues/30)] Prevent auth loops if incorrect release number is used.
- [[#38](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop/issues/38)] Battlepass data now correctly renders on smaller screens, allowing scrolling.
- [[#39](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop/issues/39)] Removes the odd cross-out line in the calendar view.
- [[#41](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop/issues/41)] Fixes average life positioning, ensuring that it can't cause overflow.
- [[#43](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop/issues/43)] Fixed the issue where the medals are not rendered on first cold boot.
- [[#45](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop/issues/45)] Fixed an issue where refreshing The Exchange with no internet will result in an infinite spinning loading indicator.
- Improved image fallback for the **Exchange**, so that missing items now render properly.
- Season calendar now includes background images for each event, operation, and battle pass season. That will make it easier to spot which season starts when!
- Calendar colors are now easier to read.
- Fixes how ranked match percentage is calculated, now showing proper values for next level. You won't need to see an oddly 
- Home page now can be scrolled on smaller screens.
- Inside match metadata, medals and ranked counterfactuals correctly flow when screen is resized. This was a bit of a problem with smaller devices (e.g., older Microsoft Surface).
- The app now correctly reacts at startup to an error with authentication token acquisition. A message is shown if that is not possible.
- General performance optimizations and maintainability cleanup - OpenSpartan Workshop now starts and aggregates data quicker.
- Fixed an issue where duplicate ranked playlist may render in the Ranked Progression view.
- Fixed an issue where duplicate items may render in the **Exchange** view.
- Massive speed up to the **Operations** view load times - the app no longer issues unnecessary REST API calls to get currency data.
