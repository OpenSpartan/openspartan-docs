If you haven't yet noticed, there is a [brand-new release on GitHub of OpenSpartan Workshop 1.0.8](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop/releases/tag/1.0.8). In terms of new features, this build is a bit light - it comes on the heels of the [Operation Fleetcom](https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/fleetcom-operation-launch), which introduced a new date format that I did not recognize for seasonal ranges, resulting in the application crashing. This has been fixed.

Additionally, a Reddit user reported an issue with OpenSpartan Workshop where progression percentages are not correctly rendered. This should also now be fixed.
